		p.
			hi, I'm WebFreak and I'm a software developer mainly using
			the #[a(href="https://dlang.org") D programming language]. I usually
			make PC programs, sometimes embedded development and some web
			development using state of the art techniques and design such as this
			page.

		h3 #[a(href="https://github.com/Pure-D/code-d") code-d] and #[a(href="https://github.com/Pure-D/serve-d") serve-d] for Visual Studio Code
		p.
			code-d is my #[a(href="https://dlang.org") D] extension
			for #[a(href="https://code.visualstudio.com/") Visual Studio Code].
			It started out as extension for #[a(href="https://atom.io/") Atom] in
			July 2015 and has transitioned to vscode with editor independent
			features.
		p.
			The atom extension started out as CoffeeScript code calling DCD, dfmt and
			D-Scanner. It became apparent that this code wouldn't be able to scale
			very well across multiple editors. When vscode was freshly released I
			quickly became interested in it and ported atomize-d to it by converting
			the coffeescript code to typescript. Maintaining the separate code bases
			didn't seem to have a good future so I
			created #[a(href="https://github.com/Pure-D/workspace-d") workspace-d] which unified
			all the functionality for all editors.
		p.
			A few years after creating workspace-d, the
			Microsoft&reg; #[a(href="https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/overview") Language Server Protocol]
			reached version 2.0 which encouraged everyone to use it. It's basically
			a different syntax from workspace-d but the underlying idea is the same.
		p.
			So I now made a wrapper for workspace-d for the Language Server Protocol
			and called it #[a(href="https://github.com/Pure-D/serve-d") serve-d].
			Currently this is the recommended program to use with Visual Studio Code
			as it implements a lot of features.

			For the free-to-play rhythm game #[a(href="https://osu.ppy.sh") osu!] I
			have made a bot, controllable using a website, which can automatically
			manage multiplayer lobbys. It adds functionality for playing lobbies with
			playlists for various play styles which are creatable by the users.
